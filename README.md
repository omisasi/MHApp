Mental Health Mobile Application over 2A Term 

Most Mental Health applications don't work for me. They either too few options that I don't get accurate resutlts for tracking my mental health or too many options (with bad organization) that I get overwhelmed. I want to develop an mental health tracking application that works for me, and hopefully, for people like me.

Currently: In design stage
